#Node (Quickly)

# Outcome

You'll:

* Have a rough idea what node is
* Have a good understanding of the module system, how to require code and export code.

# Prerequisites

* Javascript Fundamentals

#Advice

Ignore what he says Node is for. It's for any 'backend' you like really. It's not very low level IMO, it's not just for performance or event driven / real time web (dunno what real time web is...) stuff.

Hipster developers (you) tend to write backends in Ruby (on Rails) / Node (probs 30% each).

Backend: Code which does the heavy lifting of an application. It's typically hosted on a server somewhere. It will talk to DBs and have some kind of endpoint (e.g. http api) the UI (e.g. website) can talk to it through. The code can easily be kept secret (e.g. Google) and can therefore be used to make money.

# Learning materials

# Core

Skim first 3, no exercises. Level 4 in detail. (No other levels)

* [Code School Real Time Web with Node.js](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/real-time-web-with-node-js)

## Alternative

# Tasks

* Run through the code school course (1-3) probs don't bother with tasks.
* Pay close attention to Level 4. Module system + npm will be important very soon. Do the tasks for this level.
